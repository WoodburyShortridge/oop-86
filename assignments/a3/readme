Design Overview:
This program is a satellite control user interface. The satellite view allows the user to add many satellites moving around in space.
The operator can use the scroll bar to move the view horizontally and the zoom slider to zoom in and out of space.
If a satellite needs to be moved, the operator can select the troubling satellite with the mouse, this will engage it (turns green),
then it can be moved with the arrow buttons. If a satellite is really bad the operator and destroy
it with the red destroy button.

The Main.java file extends JFrame and creates the main frame for the program. This fame is closed when the operator exits the
program. The major widgets are added to the program in the main frame: satellite view, control view, and zoom slider. Each of the
views extent Jpanel. The control view contains several custom objects: two instances of arrow buttons, a delete and engage action button,
and the horizontal scroll bar. The satellite view contains a paint method for graphics. It uses an array list to keep track of added satellites
for repainting and includes a click listener for adding or engaging a satellite.
