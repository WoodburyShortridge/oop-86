Design Overview:
This program is a satellite control user interface. The satellite view displays various types of satellites rotating in space:
Research, Communications, and Weather satellites. The operator can launch more satellites into space using the ComboBox
to select satellite type and clicking the launch button. In an emergency, the operator can click the clear space button to
destroy all satellites.

Outline:
The Main.java file extends JFrame and creates the main frame for the program. This fame is closed when the operator exits the
program. The major widgets are added to the program in the main frame: satellite model, control view, and clear button. The main
frame also controls the timer that is used to animate the satellite model. The control view extends Jpanel and contains several custom objects:
a label, a satellite selector combo box, and an add button. The satellite model is an object that holds the overall satellite data: position,
type, ID, and rotation speed/direction. It also create and maintains the drawing canvas, provides the main redrawing routine for it, creates
the specific satellites for the interface. Each satellite extends an abstract satellite class that stores satellite data and builds the Basic
satellite body and ID tag. The different satellite classes extend this abstract by adding unique wings.

Compile:
$ javac *.java

Run:
$ java Main

Usage:
Select the satellite type you want to launch into space. Then click the launch button. In an emergency click the clear space button to
destroy all satellites.
