Design Overview:
This program is a simplified version of my satellite control user interface built in 3D space. There are
three different types of satellites, a cube, cylinder, and a special Torus with a spinning dodecahedron in the middle.
Each object rotates in a independently. The controller may select a satellite with the pointer. A selected satellite will
turn pink. To destroy a selected satellite the controller can press the "destroy" button. A destroyed satellite remains
will turn black. The controller can move around the galaxy by zooming and click-dragging the window.

Outline:
Each satellite is it's own class which extends THREE.Object3D and maintains it's own drawing routine. The Torus also instantiates and has a dodecahedron class.
All satellites belong to an Orbit class which is added to the scene. There are methods for listening to click position and
a button class that creates the button and method for destroying satellites.
